# Full Platform Audit — Bicollective

## A. DATABASE: Duplicate Triggers (Critical)

The `order_items` table has **3 duplicate triggers** all calling the same `decrement_stock_on_order` function:

- `decrement_stock_on_order_item`
- `on_order_item_created`
- `trg_decrement_stock_on_order`

**Impact**: Stock is decremented **3x** per order item instead of 1x. A customer buying qty 1 reduces stock by 3.

The `addresses` table has **4 duplicate triggers** all calling `unset_other_default_addresses`:

- `on_address_default_change`
- `trg_unset_other_default_addresses`
- `trg_unset_other_default_addresses_insert`
- `trigger_unset_other_defaults`

**Impact**: Redundant executions on every address change. Not functionally harmful but wasteful and violates DBMS hygiene.

**Fix**: Drop duplicates, keep one trigger per function per table.

## B. DATABASE: Schema Quality Review


| Table                      | Issue                                                                                                                                                    | Severity           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `categories.product_count` | Static column, never updated. `useCategory` hook already counts dynamically. Stale data.                                                                 | Low — cosmetic     |
| `reviews`                  | No `media_urls` column despite `ToReview.tsx` uploading media to `review-media` bucket. Media URLs are generated but **never stored** in the review row. | Medium — data loss |
| `vendor_applications`      | `user_id` FK references `auth.users` which is acceptable but NOT listed in foreign keys output — missing explicit FK constraint?                         | Low                |
| `vendor_verifications`     | `brand_id` references `brands` — correct, FK exists                                                                                                      | OK                 |
| `messages`                 | Has realtime but no `ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE public.messages` confirmed                                                            | Needs verification |
| `loyalty_progress`         | Properly structured, trigger-driven. No issues.                                                                                                          | OK                 |
| `lucky_promo_claims`       | `claimed_date` uses `CURRENT_DATE` default — correct. Unique constraint on (user_id, claimed_date) not visible but enforced by code logic.               | Minor              |

## C. FRONTEND: Unused/Dead Code


| File                               | Issue                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/data/mockData.ts` (262 lines) | Only imported by `Categories.tsx`. Categories page should use `useCategories()` hook from real DB instead. **mockData.ts is dead weight.** |
| `src/pages/Categories.tsx`         | Uses static mock data instead of Supabase — **shows hardcoded categories, not real ones**                                                  |

| `SECURITY DEFINER` functions            | `has_role`, `get_brand_owner`, stock triggers — correct       |
| Private storage buckets                 | `payment-proofs` and `vendor-documents` are private — correct |
| Admin-only edge functions               | `admin-list-users` uses service role key — correct            |
| No client-side role checks for security | Auth uses server-side role queries — correct                  |
| Cart RLS                                | Scoped to user_id — correct                                   |

## G. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN (Priority Order)

### Batch 1: Critical Database Fixes

**1. Drop duplicate triggers** (migration)

```sql
-- order_items: keep only trg_decrement_stock_on_order
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS decrement_stock_on_order_item ON order_items;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_order_item_created ON order_items;

-- addresses: keep only trg_unset_other_default_addresses
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS on_address_default_change ON addresses;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trg_unset_other_default_addresses_insert ON addresses;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_unset_other_defaults ON addresses;
```

**2. Add `media_urls` column to reviews table** (migration)

```sql
ALTER TABLE reviews ADD COLUMN media_urls text[] DEFAULT '{}';
```

Then update `ToReview.tsx` and `ReviewForm.tsx` to save URLs.

**3. Fix stock for orders already affected** — manually audit and correct stock quantities for products with triple-decremented stock.

### Batch 2: Frontend Fixes

**4. Fix Categories page** — Replace mock data import with `useCategories()` hook from `useProducts.ts`. Delete `mockData.ts` entirely.

**5. Add Wishlist button to ProductDetail** — The `toggleWishlist` function already exists but no UI button is rendered. Add Heart icon button near the cart/buy buttons.

**6. Remove or implement Size Guide** — Either link to a real size guide or remove the non-functional button. WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT SIZE GUIDE BUT THE VENDORS SHOULD HAVE THE CHOICE AND FREEDOM TO PUT IMAGE OF THIR OWN SIZE GUIDE FOR THE USERS TO SEE AS REFERENCE. MEANING, ON THE SIE GUIDE THE VENDORS SHOULD PUT A REFERNECE IMAGE OF THEIR OWN OR JUST LIST AND PUT THE DIMENSIONS OF EACH SIZE ACCORDING TO THEIR OWN SIZES. WE SHOULDNT PUT OUR OWN SIZES FOR THEIR PRODUCTS, THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WILL DECIDE WHAT THIR PRODUCT'S SIZES ARE. WE WILL ONLY RENDER WHAT THEY WANT.

### Batch 3: Consistency Improvements

**7. VendorDashboard + AdminDashboard** — Refactor from raw `useEffect` to `useQuery` for consistency with the rest of the app. (Lower priority, functional as-is.)

**8. Drop `categories.product_count` column** — It's never updated and all code computes counts dynamically. Remove to avoid confusion.

**9. Review `VendorReviews.tsx**` — Currently doesn't show reviewer names. Should join profiles table like ProductDetail does.

### Batch 4: Future Enhancements (from past plans)


| Feature                              | Source                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| In-app notification center UI        | Past audit — `messages` table exists, notifications computed but no UI bell/drawer (WE SHOULD IMPLEMENT THIS) |
| Mobile admin breadcrumb              | Past audit — mobile admin header lacks page context                                                           |
| Email notifications for order status | Original plan — not implemented (LETS IMPLEMENT THIS ON THE NOTIFICATION AT THE MOMENT NOT IN THE EMAIL)      |
| Realtime for messages table          | Table exists, RLS set, but publication not confirmed (IMPLEMENT THIS.)                                        |
| Stock validation pre-checkout        | Past audit — race condition still possible (two users, last item)(ADDRESS THIS)                               |
